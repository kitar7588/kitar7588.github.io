I graduated from the University of Shih Chien(Taiwan) with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Simulation and Design. I have been developing MR and Mobile apps for over 3 years now. I have worked in various countries and regions, collaborating with teams of different company sizes, helped them in launching their prototypes and got valuable learning experience.
